# Exercise 1

1. Given an array such as: [1,2,3,4,5], produce a new array where each number is doubled.

2. You may not use the Array `map` function built into JavaScript.

3. The function to perform the map operaton should have the following signature.

```javascript
function myMap(transformFn, arr) {

  // return value should be a new array with the values transformed
}

4. Implement the solution using the traditional `for-loop`.

5. Ensure it works.
